# AI-Git-Bot Documentation

Welcome! The documentation is organized by **who you are**. Pick your role and start from there.

---

## 👤 Users — *I work with the Git platform, a bot is already set up for me*

You interact with AI-Git-Bot entirely through Gitea / GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket — assigning issues, requesting reviews, and mentioning the bot in comments.

| Document | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Using the Bot](USING_THE_BOT.md) | Requesting reviews, talking to the bot with `@mentions`, slash commands, assigning issues to coding and writer bots, what the test workflows post on your PR |

---

## 🛠️ Administrators — *I set up and maintain the bot, its integrations, and workflows*

You run the software, connect it to your Git hosts and AI providers, and configure bots and workflows through the admin web UI.

### Connect an AI provider

Cloud providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google AI / Gemini) only need an API key — see the [Admin Guide](USER_GUIDE.md). For local LLMs:

| [PR Workflows](PR_WORKFLOWS.md) | **Start here.** What each workflow solves and the shared setup: workflow configurations, triggers, running workflows |
| [PR Review](PR_WORKFLOWS_REVIEW.md) | The default, always-on AI code review |
| [Agentic PR Review](PR_WORKFLOWS_AGENTIC_REVIEW.md) | A deeper review where the bot explores the codebase first; optional approve / request-changes |
| [Unit Tests](PR_WORKFLOWS_UNIT_TEST.md) | Auto-generated unit tests for the PR diff, run with your project's own toolchain |
| [Full-Stack QA](PR_WORKFLOWS_E2E.md) | Generated Playwright tests run against a per-PR preview |
| [README Sync](PR_WORKFLOWS_README_SYNC.md) | Keeps README and Markdown docs in sync with code changes |
| [i18n Coverage](PR_WORKFLOWS_I18N_COVERAGE.md) | Drafts missing translations across locale files against a baseline locale |
| [Issue Triage](ISSUE_TRIAGE.md) | Routes new issues to the right assignee (person, bot, or `none`) with an editable prompt |

> Preview/execution environments, MCP servers, and tool-calling are being
> reworked and are intentionally not covered in the workflow guides above.
