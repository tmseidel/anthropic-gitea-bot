# MCP Server Handling

This document describes how MCP servers are configured, how tool whitelisting works, where selected tools are shown in bot configuration, and how MCP calls are made transparent during issue implementation.

## Scope

- MCP servers are configured in **System settings → MCP configurations**.
- Only remote transports are supported (HTTP/HTTPS/WS/WSS/SSE).
- Local `stdio` MCP transport is intentionally rejected.

## 1) Create or Edit an MCP Configuration

1. Open **System settings → MCP configurations**.
2. Click **Add** or **Edit**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**
   - **MCP JSON** (remote server definitions)
4. Click **Save and select tools**.

After save, the application validates the JSON and discovers tools from all configured MCP servers.

### Example JSON

```json
[
  {
    "name": "github",
    "type": "url",
    "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
    "authorization_token": "<token>"
  }
]
```

You can also use object-style server definitions (for example with `mcpServers`) as long as remote endpoints are configured.

### Secret References in the MCP JSON

Credentials in the MCP JSON do not have to be written into the configuration itself. `authorization_token` (including its `authorizationToken` / `token` aliases) and every `headers` value accept a [secret reference](SECRET_REFERENCES.md), which is resolved each time a request to the MCP server is made:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "github",
    "type": "url",
    "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
    "authorization_token": "${env:GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN}",
    "headers": {"X-Api-Key": "${env:MY_API_KEY}"}
  }
]
```

With `${env:...}`, the environment variable must be listed in `GITEABOT_SECRET_ENV_WHITELIST` before it can be read; nothing is readable by default. Escaping (`$${env:NAME}`), mixing references with literal text (`"Bearer ${env:TOKEN}"`), what happens when a reference cannot be resolved, the reserved variable names, and how to add further secret sources are all described in [Secret References](SECRET_REFERENCES.md) — the mechanism is not MCP-specific.

MCP-specific detail: only `authorization_token` and `headers` values are resolved. The `url` field does **not** support secret references, because MCP endpoints are logged for diagnostics.

## 2) Select MCP Tools (Whitelist)

After saving an MCP configuration, the tool-selection page opens automatically.

You can also open it any time without changing JSON:

- **System settings → MCP configurations → Tools**
- **Edit MCP configuration → Select tools**

The table supports:

- filtering by text
- server filter
- sorting by server/tool/title
- paging and configurable page size
- per-row checkbox selection
- **select all visible** in the table header

Only selected tools are persisted and appended to agent system prompts.

Unselected tools remain hidden from the AI agent.

## 3) View Selected Tools in Bot Configuration

In **Bots → New/Edit**, next to the MCP configuration dropdown, use **Details**.

The details dialog shows a read-only list of the selected tools for that MCP configuration:

- server
- tool name
- title
- description

This is based on the persisted whitelist selection.

## 4) How Prompt Exposure Works

At runtime, the application discovers MCP tools and then applies the persisted whitelist before rendering MCP tool entries into prompts.

Result: the agent only sees and can call whitelisted MCP tools.

## 5) Transparency of MCP Calls During Issue Work

### Current behavior

- MCP tool calls are executed by the issue/writer agent loop.
- MCP tools are handled as silent tools (same category as internal context/file tools).
- Issue comments are not spammed with per-call MCP request/response payloads.

### What is visible in issue comments

- high-level agent progress/comments
- validation command feedback (where applicable)

### Where to inspect exact MCP call behavior

Use application logs for detailed MCP transparency:

- transport/connection attempts
- initialization/discovery diagnostics
- MCP tool execution failures

This keeps issue threads readable while still allowing technical traceability in logs.

## 6) Exposing Deployment-Style Tools

The bot can use any MCP server as a *deployment
target* — the `MCPDeploymentStrategy` lets a PR workflow trigger, observe
and tear down per-PR preview environments by calling regular MCP tools on
an already configured server.

### Expected tool shape

You expose **up to three** tools on the MCP server. Their qualified names
are configured per deployment target (see
[doc/PR_WORKFLOWS.md → Deployment targets](PR_WORKFLOWS.md#deployment-targets-m3)):

| Role          | Required | Receives                                                                 | Returns (JSON)                                                                                          |
|---------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `deployTool`   | yes      | the rendered `argsTemplate` (see below)                                  | `{ "previewUrl": "..." }` → `READY`, or `{ "handle": {...} }` → `PENDING`, or `{ "status": "failed", "error": "..." }` |
| `statusTool`   | optional | `{ runId, prNumber, repoOwner, repoName, handle }`                       | same shape as `deployTool` — used by the bot's poller to upgrade `PENDING` → `READY` / `FAILED`         |
| `teardownTool` | optional | `{ runId, prNumber, repoOwner, repoName, handle }`                       | any (bot only inspects success)                                                                          |

Argument payload available to `deployTool` (placeholders are substituted in
the operator-defined `argsTemplate`; if `argsTemplate` is omitted, the bot
sends a flat envelope with all of these keys):

| Placeholder         | Example value                                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{prNumber}`        | `1234`                                                          |
| `{sha}`             | `deadbeefcafe…`                                                 |
| `{branch}`          | `feature/x`                                                     |
| `{repoOwner}`       | `acme`                                                          |
| `{repoName}`        | `web`                                                           |
| `{runId}`           | `42` (persistent `PrWorkflowRun.id`)                            |
| `{callbackUrl}`     | `https://bot.acme.io/api/workflow-callback/42/<callbackSecret>` |
| `{callbackSecret}`  | per-run secret — useful if you eventually want to POST back     |

### Whitelisting

All three tool names **must** be ticked in **System settings → MCP
configurations → Tools** before the deployment target can be saved:

- the admin-UI save handler calls `McpToolSelectionService.selectedQualifiedToolNameSet(id)`
  and rejects the form otherwise (`HTTP 400` with an actionable message);
- the strategy enforces the same check a second time at runtime, so
  removing a tool from the whitelist after the fact safely degrades to a
  `REJECTED` deployment instead of a silent execution.

### Polling, not callbacks

`MCPDeploymentStrategy.awaitsCallback() == false` — MCP servers do not
deliver HTTP callbacks into the bot. After `trigger()` returns `PENDING`,
the bot's scheduled `DeploymentPoller` invokes `statusTool` at the target's
configured interval (`timeoutSeconds` is the upper bound) until it
observes `READY` / `FAILED`. The operator never has to wire up an inbound
HMAC endpoint for an MCP-backed target.

### When to choose MCP vs. WEBHOOK

| Choose `MCP` when…                                                | Choose `WEBHOOK` when…                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| You already operate an internal platform MCP server.              | Your deploy lives in Jenkins / CI directly.                  |
| You want everything (tool whitelist, audit) under one MCP roof.   | You need a callback channel because deploy is fire-and-forget. |
| Your deploy/status flow is naturally request/response.            | The CI side cannot easily call out to an MCP server.         |
